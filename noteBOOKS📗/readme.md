## Cv001 
demostrating some usage of _opencv_ in dealing with images and videos input 
and doing some Color threshold to remove the background from an image and replace it 
* [notebook cv001](/cv001.ipynb)
--------------------------------------------------------
How can different color spaces affect the process of detecting some colors easily ? 
--------------------------------------------------------
Color spaces 
- RGB (Red, Green, Blue) <0, 255> 
- HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) <0=>180>
- HLS (Huc, Lightness, Saturation) 
in this notebok I used several images of ballons to compare them in various filters and masks 
to show which is better in detecting the color for this case 'pink'
