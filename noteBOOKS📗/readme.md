## Cv001 
demostrating some usage of _opencv_ in dealing with images and videos input 
and doing some Color threshold to remove the background from an image and replace it 


[notebook cv001](/cv001.ipynb)
--------------------------------------------------------
How can different color spaces affect the process of detecting some colors easily ? 
--------------------------------------------------------
Color spaces 
- RGB (Red, Green, Blue) <0, 255> 
- HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) <0=>180>
- HLS (Huc, Lightness, Saturation) 
in this notebok I used several images of ballons to compare them in various filters and masks 
to show which is better in detecting the color for this case 'pink'

How can different between Night and Day in images using features extracted from the images ?

Applying some filters and see how they help in edge detecting

[filtersüñºÔ∏è](filters.ipynb)
contains some studies of how 
- to make custome kerenal 
- to use guassian filter
- low pass filters 
- high pass filters
- cane edge detection 
- hysteresis thresholding 
- a function to plot one row of images and another one to plot a grid of images 
**ploting one row**
```python
def plot2(images, rows, cols, labels = None, sizex = 20, sizey = 10):
    if len(images) < rows * cols:
        print("Number of images is less than the number of subplots.")
        return
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(rows, cols, figsize=(sizex, sizey))
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            axs[j].imshow(images[j], cmap = 'gray')
            if labels:
                axs[j].set_title(labels[j])
            else :
                axs[j].set_title(f"image_{j}")
    plt.show()
```
**ploting a grid of images**
```python
def plot_images(images, rows, cols, labels = None, sizex = 20, sizey = 10):
    if len(images) < rows * cols and rows != 1:
        print("Number of images is less than the number of subplots. or rows = 1")
        return
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(rows, cols, figsize=(sizex, sizey))
    for row in range(rows):
        for col in range(cols):
            axs[row,col].imshow(images[row*cols+col])
            if labels:
                axs[row,col].set_title(labels[row*cols+col])
            else:
                axs[row,col].set_title(f"image_{row*cols+col}")
    plt.show()
```
note that üí° ```labels```, ```sizex```, ```sizey``` are optional parameters
that mean you can use it as follow :
```python
plot2([image1, image2], 1, 2, ['sunny', 'not sunny'])
```
or 
'''
plot2([image1, image2], 1, 2, sizex = 40, sizey = 60)
'''
in the last case the images takes a default name as image_<image_index>
we can also ommit the ```sizex``` and ```sizey```
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fourier transformation
```python
# perform a fast fourier transform and create a scaled, frequency transform image
def ft_image(norm_image):
    '''This function takes in a normalized, grayscale image
       and returns a frequency spectrum transform of that image. '''
    f = np.fft.fft2(norm_image)
    fshift = np.fft.fftshift(f)
    frequency_tx = 20*np.log(np.abs(fshift))
    
    return frequency_tx
  ```
  ft_image()  takes in a grayscale image and applies a **fast Fourier transform (FFT)** to it using the ```np.fft.fft2()``` function. The FFT is a mathematical technique that can be used to decompose an image into its sine and cosine components, effectively breaking it down into its different frequency components.

The function then uses ```np.fft.fftshift()``` to shift the zero-frequency component to the center of the image. This is done so that the resulting frequency spectrum is more easily interpretable. The absolute value of the shifted FFT is then taken and the logarithm is applied to increase the visibility of the frequency components.

In this way, the resulting image that is returned from this function is a frequency spectrum transform of the input image which shows the different frequency components that make up the original image.
